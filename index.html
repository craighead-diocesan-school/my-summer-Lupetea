<h1> My Summer
</h1>


<h2> My Chillaxed Summer at Home
</h2>

<p>Nothing more than an ordinary Summer. My summer was mostly spent at home, which in my opinion is the ideal destination. Reflecting on life and catching up with all the sleep school cost me. 
</p>

<h2>What I did:
</h2>

  <li>Slept for half the day (almost)
  </li>
  <li>Read random books to get my mind of stressing about going to a new school
  </li>
  <li>Hung out with my friends from T.C.S, also tried to adjust to the fact we      won't see each other daily or very often anymore.
  </li>
