    <h2>A Brief Overview of What I did throughout Summer:</h2>

    <li>Slept for half the day (almost)</li>
    <li>Read random books to get my mind of stressing about going to a new school</li>
    <li>Hung out with my friends from T.C.S, also tried to adjust to the fact we won't see each other daily or very often anymore.</li>
    <li>I went to Christchurch a few times and Oamaru for a quick escape from Timaru.</li>
